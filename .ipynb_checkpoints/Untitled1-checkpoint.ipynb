Laserlink connection. IMAGE Stabilization, remote.', \"The Sony TRV310 Handycam provides top-of-the-line digital recording with a host of advanced options, including a large 3.5-inch LCD screen. Its powerful 360x digital zoom, wide range of special effects, image stabilization, and Sony's unique infrared night recording capabilities make it a great choice for those needing high-end digital camcorder features. Sony's elongated Handycam design fits easily in one hand and is well-balanced. While not the lightest of camcorders, we found the Handycam line to be one of the most ergonomic and easy to use.\", \"The Sony TRV310 Handycam has a nifty status screen on the outside of the LCD screen module that lets you know how many minutes you've recorded or how far you've played a tape. It also tells you if there's a tape in the camcorder. This screen is backlit for maximum visibility.\", \"The LCD screen swivels 210 degrees, which lets you record above your head or put yourself in the picture. The optical viewfinder is black and white, which is not a real drawback since we ended up using the LCD screen for most of our shooting. The unit's playback buttons are backlit, making it easier to use the Sony TRV310 Handycam as a VCR. This video camera also comes with a remote control unit.\", 'The Sony TRV310 Handycam lets you manually adjust focus and exposure; it also includes seven programmed exposure modes, plus backlight compensation, to help optimize your video under different shooting conditions. It provides three recording modes--normal, hold-down, and five-second--to help you take short, lively video segments. The TRV310 also lets you record still photos. It features a high-powered 360x digital zoom, great for getting closeups and recording faraway events. This Handycam also provides electronic image stabilization to minimize camera shake, which is especially useful when using the zoom or during fast-action events.', \"We enjoyed Sony's full range of special effects, including the distinctive pastel, slim, and stretch picture modes. The TRV310 provides widescreen, black-and-white, sepia, negative, and solarized modes. We also liked the range of fade options, which include fade to black, mosaic, monotone, overlap, and a bounce-image effect. The camera includes digital effects for playback, including still, flash, lumi, slow shutter, old movie, and trail modes. You can even insert a scene in the middle of a recording.\", \"The camcorder includes Sony's exclusive NightShot capability, which lets you shoot video in total darkness. The camcorder emits an invisible infrared beam to light the scene. The resulting video is basically black and white and lower quality than normal, but being able to get decent images in complete darkness is nonetheless pretty amazing. The TRV310 also comes with a mount for an external standard light.\", \"This camcorder uses the Digital 8 format, which lets you record digital video on a standard Hi8 tape. Digital video gives you extraordinary video quality--up to 500 lines of resolution and CD-quality sound; it's the top-of-the-line format. The digital format allows you to take digital still pictures, just like a digital camera. If you want to download and edit your digital still images and video on a computer, however, you have to purchase a separate video capture card first. You can also use this camcorder to play back analog 8mm and Hi8 tapes--a handy feature if you have previously recorded video in these formats.\", '<b>Pros:</b><br> <ul> <li>Large 3.5-inch LCD screen <li>Super-powerful zoom <li>Still photo capability <li>High-quality digital format <li>Great selection of special effects <li>Image stabilization </ul>', '<b>Cons:</b><br> <ul> <li>Optical viewfinder is black and white </ul>']\n",

You can also call up an onscreen program index that shows the time, date, channel, and type (optional) of every timed recording made on a tape, as long as the cassette is in the machine. You can record brief index notes at the opening of tape segments.<P> We have one minor complaint about this VCR: Panasonic's fine-edged recording/playback heads for the SLP mode are excellent if you are watching a slow-speed recording, but they sometimes mistrack when you are watching super long play (SLP) recordings made on older decks.

With its wide 50mm objective lenses and high magnification, these rugged, all-weather Canon Image Stabilizer binoculars are destined to set a new and higher benchmark for image brightness, clarity and ergonomic design.', \"Canon's 18x50 IS binoculars incorporate an optical image stabilizer for shake-free viewing and minimal eye fatigue. This technology was first developed for Canon video camcorders and is now available in many of Canon's binoculars. The system employs a Vari-Angle Prism, dual transparent plates, independent vertical and horizontal sensors, and a dedicated microprocessor to continuously adjust the prism to maintain a steady image.\", \"The 18x50 IS binoculars feature a water-resistant, shock-resistant rubber coating for a nonslip grip and better durability. If you get caught in the rain and still want to view, you don't have to worry about the optics fogging up. These binoculars deliver high magnification and wide-field viewing. Controls for focusing and image stabilization are centrally located and accessible by both hands. These binoculars provide long eye relief for extra comfort.\", '<B>Image Stabilization and More</B><br> <img hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"7\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/canon-is-on-off.jpg\" align=\"right\"> With any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake. Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless. Canon\\'s IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon\\'s professional broadcast quality video recording equipment. A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars. Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism. The VAP shape alters to refract or \\'bend\\' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration. It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake.', \"<B>Super Spectra Coating</B><br> A number of optical factors affect the brightness of an image, including the amount of incidental light that is reflected by the lens. An uncoated lens will refelect away as much as 8% of the incidentail light, significantly dimming the image. Canon's Super Spectra Coating prevents that reflection.\", '<B>What do the numbers mean?</B><br> 15x50? 8x25? The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification  8x, 12x, 15x and so on  and the diameter of their objective lenses  25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on. The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens. For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away. The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations. <p clear=left> <B>A look inside</B><br> <CENTER> <img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/canon-10x30-99.jpg\" align=\"center\"> </CENTER> <p clear=left>']\n"
